# Python: Pythagorean Triplet

There exists exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which a + b + c = 1000. Find the product a * b * c.

A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, {a, b, c}, for
which,

```
a**2 + b**2 = c**2
```

For example, 

```
3**2 + 4**2 = 9 + 16 = 25 = 5**2.
```

To run a test file, pass it as an argument to the `python` command:

    python hello_world_test.py

If you want to stop the tests after the first failure, then you can use the pytest library.

Install pytest with pip:

    pip install pytest

Run the tests with the `py.test` command using the `-x` flag to exit after the first failure.

    py.test -x hello_world_test.py
